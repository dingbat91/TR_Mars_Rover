# The Vehicle Class

This section holds the Vehicle class and it's subclasses

Vehicles should hold all information of the basic functionality of a vehicle itself (without modules)
Vehicles are attached to a Mapgrid on intiation. This allows them to reference the grid as needed. But direct manipulation of the grid should be done in the Grid Class when possible.
